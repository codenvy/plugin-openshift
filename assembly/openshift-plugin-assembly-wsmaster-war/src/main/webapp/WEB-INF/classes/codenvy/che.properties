### CHE SERVER
# Folder where Che will store internal data objects
che.database=${che.home}/storage

# API service. Browsers initiate REST communications to Che server with this URL
che.api=http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api

# Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each
# workspace. This is the directory in the ws runtime where your projects are mounted.
che.workspace.storage=${che.home}/workspaces

# Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each
# workspace. This is the directory in the machine where your projects are placed.
che.workspace.projects.storage=/projects

# Configures proxies used by runtimes powering workspaces
che.workspace.http_proxy=
che.workspace.https_proxy=
che.workspace.no_proxy=

# Configures dns resolving servers. May contain several values separated by comma sign.
che.dns.resolvers=

# During the stop of the workspace automatically creates a snapshot if the value is {true},
# Otherwise just stops the workspace.
che.workspace.auto_snapshot=true

# During the start of the workspace automatically restore it from a snapshot if the value is {true},
# Otherwise create a new workspace.
che.workspace.auto_restore=true

# By default, when users access to a workspace with its URL the workspace
# automatically starts if it is stopped. You can set this to false to disable this.
che.workspace.auto_start=true

# Workspace threads pool configuration, this pool is used for workspace related
# operations that require asynchronous execution e.g. starting/stopping/snapshotting

# possible values are 'fixed', 'cached'
che.workspace.pool.type=fixed

# This property is ignored when pool type is different from 'fixed'.
# Configures the exact size of the pool, if it's set multiplier property is ignored.
# If this property is not set(0, < 0, NULL) then pool sized to number of cores,
#it can be modified within multiplier
che.workspace.pool.exact_size=NULL

# This property is ignored when pool type is different from 'fixed' or exact pool size is set.
# If it's set the pool size will be N_CORES * multiplier

che.workspace.maven.options=NULL

# Folder that will be a volume mount from your host into your workspace.
che.workspace.volume=

# If your workspace creates SSH connections, their timeouts are managed by this property.
che.workspace.ssh_connection_timeout_ms=10000

# The location of the Web terminal used within the browser.

# Che injects this archive into machines when they are booted or started.
# Each machine can have many agents installed, each located in a different location.
che.workspace.agent.dev=${che.home}/lib/ws-agent.tar.gz

# Hosts listed here will be added to /etc/hosts of each workspace.
che.workspace.hosts=NULL

# This is the API endpoint of the workspace master running within the core Che server.

### AGENTS
# When the Che server launches a new workspace, Che pings a mini Che server running inside of the
# workspace runtime. We call this mini-Che an "agent". The Che server knows that the workspace
# is ready for user when the agent returns a valid response.
che.workspace.agent.dev.max_start_time_ms=180000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms=2000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_conn_timeout_ms=2000
che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_timeout_error_msg=Timeout. The Che server is unable to ping your workspace. This implies a network configuration issue, workspace boot failure, or an unusually slow workspace boot.

che.agent.dev.max_start_time_ms=120000
che.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms=2000

### TEMPLATES
# Folder that contains JSON files with code templates and samples
che.template.storage=${che.home}/templates

# Che has a single identity implementation, so this does not change the user experience.
# If true, enables user creation at API level
che.auth.user_self_creation=false

che.auth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth

# Reserved user names
che.auth.reserved_user_names=

# You can setup GitHub oAuth to automate authentication to remote repositories.
# You need to first register this application with GitHub oAuth.

che.oauth.github.redirecturis= http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api/oauth/callback


### DOCKER PARAMETERS
# Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered by machines
# that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to generate containers
# for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private Docker registry.
che.docker.registry=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000

# If this is true, then we always pull an image from a registry even if we have an image cached
# locally. If false, Docker only pulls image if it does not exist locally.
che.docker.always_pull_image=true

# If true, then launches all workspace runtime containers with Docker's
# privileged mode. Please use responsibly. This is required if you want Che workspaces
# to be able to launch their own runtimes which are embedded Docker containers.
che.docker.privileged=false

# Limits the number of processes that can be forked inside a cgroup. Set -1 for unlimited.
# Since 4.3 kernel.
che.docker.pids_limit=-1

# Sets parent cgroup for cgroups of containers created by workspaces.
# This allows an admin to set custom cgroup limitations to all containers of workspaces by configuring cgroups.
# Example:
# /my_group
# my_another_group
che.docker.parent_cgroup=NULL

# Sets set of CPUs that can be used by each container of started workspace.
# Example:
# 0-3
# 1,4
che.docker.cpuset_cpus=NULL

# Next 2 properties set limits on CPU consumption by containers of started workspaces.
# Period sets amount of units per CPU core.
# Quota sets amount of units available for container per whole CPU.
# Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
# Example:
# che.docker.cpu_period=5000
# che.docker.cpu_quota=10000
che.docker.cpu_period=0
che.docker.cpu_quota=0

# Adds options when mounting the /projects volume.

# Adds options when mounting the /mnt/che/terminal, /mnt/che/ws-agent.tar.gz, /mnt/che/conf volume
che.docker.volumes_agent_options=ro,Z

# If the browser clients that are accessing Che are remote AND the configuration of Docker is an
# internal IP address or using Unix sockets, then remote browser clients will not be able to connect
# to the workspace. Set the Docker configuration so that Docker containers have an external IP
# address and provide that external host or IP address here.
# This is uncommon, and only needed for advanced Docker configurations.
che.docker.ip=NULL

# The hostname that a browser should use to connect to a workspace container.
# Only set this if your workspace containers are not directly pingable.
# This is unusual, but happens for example in Docker for Mac when containers are in a VM.
che.docker.ip.external=NULL

# The server evaluation strategy to be used to determine servers exposed by workspaces.
# Options:
#   - 'default':      internal address is address of docker host and ephemeral port are used
#   - 'docker-local': internal address is address of container within docker network, and exposed ports
#                     are used.
# The 'docker-local' strategy may be useful if a firewall prevents communication between che-server and
# workspace containers, but will prevent communication when che-server and workspace containers are not
# on the same Docker network.
che.docker.server_evaluation_strategy=default

# Provides a Docker network where Che server is running.
# Workspace containers created by Che will be added to this Docker network.
# Communications between the Che server and container occur over this network.
